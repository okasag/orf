Title: An Implementation of the Ordered Forest Estimator
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Author: Gabriel Okasa
Maintainer: Gabriel Okasa <gabriel.okasa@unisg.ch>
Description: An implementation of the Ordered Forest estimator 
    as in Lechner & Okasa (2019). The Ordered Forest flexibly 
    estimates the conditional probabilities of models with ordered 
    categorical outcomes (so-called ordered choice models). 
    Additionally to common machine learning algorithms the orf 
    package provides functions for estimating marginal effects as well 
    as statistical inference thereof and thus provides similar output 
    as in standard econometric models for ordered choice. The core 
    forest algorithm relies on the fast C++ forest implementation 
    from the ranger package.
