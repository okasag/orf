Description: An implementation of the Ordered Forest estimator as developed 
    in Lechner & Okasa (2019) <arXiv:1907.02436>. The Ordered Forest flexibly
    estimates the conditional probabilities of models with ordered categorical
    outcomes (so-called ordered choice models). Additionally to common machine 
    learning algorithms the 'orf' package provides functions for estimating
    marginal effects as well as statistical inference thereof and thus provides
    similar output as in standard econometric models for ordered choice. The
    core forest algorithm relies on the fast C++ forest implementation from
    the 'ranger' package (Wright & Ziegler, 2017) <arXiv:1508.04409>.
