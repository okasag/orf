Description: An Implementation of the Ordered Random Forest Algorithm
    as in Lechner & Okasa (2019) and other related estimators for 
    discrete choice models based on the random forest algorithm.
    These include models with ordered, multinomial as well as binary
    response. Standard random forest estimator for continuous response
    is implemented, too. All the forest based algorithms rely on the
    fast C++ forest implementation from the ranger package. Additionally
    to common implementations the orf package provides functions for
    estimating forest weights as well as marginal effects and thus
    provides similar output as in standard econometric models for
    ordered choice.
