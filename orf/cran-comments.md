## Resubmission
* this is the resubmission addressing the comment of Martina Schmirl
* thank you for your time to review the package

## Changes in this Resubmission
### Issue 1
* **CRAN**: Please always write package names, software names and API names in
single quotes in title and description. e.g: --> 'ranger'
* **Gabriel**: I changed the DESCRIPTION file accordingly.
Thereby this issue should be resolved.

* There were no further issues.
* Additionally to the previous resubmission I have now updated the package version 
in the DESCRIPTION file from '0.1.1' to '0.1.2' and updated the date as well.
* I documented the update in the NEWS.md file.

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 18.04, R 3.6.1
* local macOS 10.15, R 3.6.1
* local windows 10, R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
* There were 0 ERRORs and 0 WARNINGs and 1 NOTEs. 

* the 1 NOTE is due to the first submission.
* both names were marked as possibly mis-spelled but these are correct.

## Downstream dependencies
